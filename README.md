## Preperation
### Steps
1. Research & Information
  - [x] Follow [InfoSec Taylor Swift](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity) (Mostly to get on this [alert list](https://twitter.com/swiftonsecurity/status/780576809599590400))
  - [x] Get "The Cyber" clip [by Trump](https://youtu.be/oQM-jcZqVBI?t=46s)
  - Find some good resources:
    - [ ] Search Google
    - [ ] Search Github
    - [ ] Search Job Applications
    - [ ] Talk to people
2. Learn everything I can :heart:

### Skills
#### Reverse engineering
  - Battelle says: (link #1)
  
    > Software and hardware reverse engineers disassemble targets into discrete components so they can be thoroughly documented and understood.
    >
    > The process varies depending on the target, but ultimately the end goal of a reverse engineer is to answer specific questions about a target, such as:
    >
    > - What capabilities does this software have?
    > - How exactly does this algorithm work?
    > - Is this device capable of wireless communication?
    > - Are there any physical debugging ports on this circuit board and how can we connect to them?

#### Vulnerability research
  - Battelle says: (link #1)
 
    > Vulnerability researchers hunt for weaknesses in software. Whether that software runs as a desktop application, or handles the boot process on your cool new gadget, vulnerability researchers aim to make software fail in order to prove weak spots.
    >
    > Strong vulnerability researchers should be able to:
    >
    > - Understand how software developers think, as well as the mistakes they typically make.
    > - Aim for control.
    > - Understand how to profile the characteristics of software bugs, and if possible, gain control over execution, leak information or inject commands they should not be able to.
    > - Prey on the mistakes of forward engineers, whether it's to patch critical security flaws or insert additional capabilities through advanced tool development.

#### Code auditing
#### Cryptography
#### Web exploitation
