## Preperation
### Steps
1. Research & Information
  - [x] Follow [InfoSec Taylor Swift](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity) (Mostly to get on this [alert list](https://twitter.com/swiftonsecurity/status/780576809599590400))
  - [x] Get "The Cyber" clip [by Trump](https://youtu.be/oQM-jcZqVBI?t=46s)
  - Find some good resources:
    - [ ] Search Google
    - [ ] Search Github
    - [ ] Search Job Applications
    - [ ] Talk to people
2. Learn everything I can :heart:

### Career Types

### Skills
#### Reverse engineering
  - Battelle says: (link #1)
    ```text,wrap
    Software and hardware reverse engineers disassemble targets into discrete components so they can be thoroughly documented and understood.
    
    The process varies depending on the target, but ultimately the end goal of a reverse engineer is to answer specific questions about a target, such as:

    - What capabilities does this software have?
    - How exactly does this algorithm work?
    - Is this device capable of wireless communication?
    - Are there any physical debugging ports on this circuit board and how can we connect to them?
    ```

#### Vulnerability research
  - Battelle says: (link #1)
    ```text,wrap
    Vulnerability researchers hunt for weaknesses in software. Whether that software runs as a desktop application, or handles the boot process on your cool new gadget, vulnerability researchers aim to make software fail in order to prove weak spots.

    Strong vulnerability researchers should be able to:

    - Understand how software developers think, as well as the mistakes they typically make.
    - Aim for control.
    - Understand how to profile the characteristics of software bugs, and if possible, gain control over execution, leak information or inject commands they should not be able to.
    - Prey on the mistakes of forward engineers, whether it's to patch critical security flaws or insert additional capabilities through advanced tool development.
    ```
#### Code auditing
#### Cryptography
#### Web exploitation
